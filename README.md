# Spaceship-Survival

The Spaceship Titanic which had almost 13,000 passengers collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. We were asked to predict whether the passenger survived or not based on the given data. After cleaning, visualising and analysing the data we used classification models on the training data and finally used the most promising model on the test data to predict the outcome.
